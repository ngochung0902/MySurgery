<h4>Medications</h4><p>Any medicines you’re taking could react with the anaesthetic or other medicines you may receive during surgery. It’s important to stop taking some medicines several weeks before surgery. Your doctor will tell you exactly what medicines to stop and when.<p>Remember, medicine is a science, not guesswork.</p><p>If you are not sure about something, simply call your doctor.</p><p>It’s even important to tell your doctor if you are taking natural remedies such as fish oil, and as good as the human memory can be, it’s far from perfect, so be sure to mark your medicine stop times in a diary.</p>If you take any blood thinning medicines you must get special instructions from your doctor or the hospital.
