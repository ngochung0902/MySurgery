<h4>Fasting</h4><p>For most surgery you’ll require medicine to go to sleep. When you’re asleep your throat muscles relax and any food in your stomach can escape and get into your lungs.</p><p>That’s why, it’s important to stop eating anything at least 6 hoursbefore your surgery.</p><p>Hospital staff will contact you in the days before your surgery with exact instructions.</p><p>Fasting means going without all food and liquid. Sometimes in hospital we call this “Nil By Mouth”.  Fasting is needed before general anaesthesia or sedation.</p><li>You can have solid food until 6 hours before surgery - this should only be a light meal.</li><li>Do not chew gum or lollies- these count as food because they cause the stomach to produce extra acid.</li><li>Adult patients can have clear fluids until 2 hours before surgery. This should be no more than 2 cups or 400mls. </li><li>Ask when you should fast from.</li>
