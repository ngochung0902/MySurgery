<h4>Who will be at home</h4><p>If you are cleared to go home, you must have someone stay with you the night after your surgery.</p><p>If you have had a General Anaesthetic or sedation you will need to have a responsible adult take you home and stay overnight with you. This is for your own safety as you may be lightheaded and drowsy. Your ability to do tasks may be affected. A small amount of anaesthetic may still be in your body.</p><p>You must not drive home after surgery. It is not safe.</p><p>If you don’t have a family member or friend able to pick you up and stay with you please tell the hospital staff. We want you to have your surgery but we also want you to be safe afterwards. </p>
