<h4>Wellness</h4><p>The whole point of surgery is to help you get well. So it makes sense that you might not feel like turning somersaults in the weeks before your procedure. Nevertheless, do try to do some light exercise every day. It’ll help you recover faster after surgery.</p><p>It’s also important to be clean. Having a bath or shower before coming in reduces the risk of infection during your procedure.</p><p>If you are unwell within 3 days before your surgery you will need to call the hospital or contact your local doctor for advice. If you are too unwell for surgery, it may be postponed until you are feeling better and it is safer for you to have an anaesthetic. </p><p>If you have any of the following please call us: </p>	<li>Temperature or fever- feeling hot or cold </li>	<li>Sore throat </li>	<li>Rash or swelling </li>	<li>Feel unwell </li>	<li>A cut, break or tear in your skin </li>	<li>Any infected wounds </li>	<li>Diarrhoea or vomiting </li>	<li>A recent unplanned visit to the Emergency Department or local doctor</li>
