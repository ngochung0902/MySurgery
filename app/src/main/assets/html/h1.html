<h4>Waiting times</h4><p>Surgery waiting times can be long. It may take days, weeks or even months from the time you first visit your GP to when you have your surgery.</p><p>Many things can happen to change your waiting time so the hospital will only give you an estimated waiting time until they really know when to contact you stating the exact time of your surgery.</p>It is important to let the Hospital know if you no longer require surgery or have already had it elsewhere.
