<h4>Introduction</h4><br><p>Every week, thousands of Australians have surgery, and you're one of them, which means you need to be prepared.</p>The <em><strong>My Surgery Journey</strong></em> app provides information about the time before surgery. You should use it together with your family and talk about the information. The app will help you get ready for surgery, remind you of important dates and help you get to the hospital. <p>Ask your local doctor or surgeon if you have any questions.</p> <p>If you're late to hospital, miss your appointment, or haven't followed your doctor's instructions your surgery may be delayed or even cancelled.</p> <p>When surgery is cancelled it's not possible to simply bring in the next patient, as the theatre has been set up just for you.</p> So, make the most of your <em><strong>My Surgery Journey</strong></em> app to ensure you're ready for surgery.
